# ComfyStudio

ComfyStudio is a desktop animatic, previsualization, and AI-assisted editing tool built around a local ComfyUI workflow.

It combines a timeline editor, asset browser, Generate workspace, stock search, LM Studio prompt helper, and export queue in one app.

## Download

Download the current public build from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/JaimeIsMe/comfystudio/releases).

The current public release is marked as a pre-release while early setup feedback comes in.

Available release assets include:

- Windows installer
- Windows portable build
- macOS Apple Silicon DMG
- macOS Intel DMG

## What It Does

- Edit projects with assets, preview, timeline, inspector, and export tools.
- Generate images, videos, and audio through curated local or cloud workflows.
- Use Director Mode to turn structured script input into keyframes and video shots.
- Search Pexels stock footage and stills directly from the app.
- Refine prompts locally with LM Studio.

## Core Product Decisions

- ComfyUI is local-only in this build. Remote and LAN ComfyUI targets are intentionally disabled.
- The default ComfyUI endpoint is `http://127.0.0.1:8188`, but users can override the port in Settings.
- LM Studio integration is local-only.
- Generate includes dependency preflight checks before queueing workflows.

## Requirements

Minimum for development or local use:

- Node.js 18+
- npm
- ComfyUI installed separately and running locally

Optional integrations:

- Pexels API key for the `Stock` tab
- Comfy account API key for paid partner-node workflows
- LM Studio for local prompt assistance in the `LLM` tab

## Quick Start

### Windows

```bash
npm install
npm run electron:dev
```

### macOS

```bash
npm install
npm run electron:dev
```

The packaged desktop app is the intended experience. Browser-only `npm run dev` is still useful for frontend work, but Electron is the normal development path.

## First Run

When you first open the app:

1. Choose a projects folder.
2. Create or open a project.
3. Open `ComfyStudio > Getting Started` from the bottom menu for the built-in setup and orientation guide.

The `Getting Started` guide is manual by design. It does not auto-open.

## ComfyUI Setup

ComfyStudio ships with built-in workflow JSON files, but that does not mean every workflow will work immediately on every machine.

Users still need the correct combination of:

- ComfyUI custom nodes
- model files
- local GPU capacity for local workflows
- partner API credentials for cloud workflows

### ComfyUI Port

- Default: `8188`
- Open `Settings > ComfyUI Connection` to change or test the local port.
- Only localhost or loopback addresses are accepted in this build.

### Dependency Checks

Inside `Generate`, choose a workflow and use the dependency check tools if something is missing.

The current workflow help flow includes:

- dependency preflight before queueing
- `Re-check`
- `Copy report`
- `Open node registry`
- `Open in ComfyUI`

## Generate Overview

### Single Mode

Use this for one-off image, video, or audio generations.

### Director Mode

Use this for a guided sequence:

1. `Setup`
2. `Script`
3. `Keyframes`
4. `Videos`

Director Mode supports a structured script format so the app can parse scene context, shot type, keyframe prompt, motion prompt, camera direction, and duration.

Example:

```text
Scene 1: Neon Arrival
Scene context: Futuristic transit terminal, blue and coral neon, reflective black tile, premium cinematic sneaker ad.

Shot 1:
Shot type: Wide shot
Keyframe prompt: Wide shot of the model stepping through sliding glass doors into a futuristic transit terminal, blue and coral neon reflecting across glossy black tile, coral-and-cream sneaker clearly visible.
Motion prompt: Starting from this exact keyframe, the model takes 2 confident steps forward while neon reflections slide across the floor. Keep the sneaker, outfit, and terminal lighting consistent.
Camera: Gentle backward tracking shot
Duration: 3
```

## Hardware Tiers

ComfyStudio tags workflows in `Generate` with a hardware tier to make setup expectations clearer.

| Tier | Meaning | Typical workflows | Practical guidance |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lite | Lower-end local GPU | Z Image Turbo, Music Generation | Often workable on 6-8 GB VRAM |
| Standard | Mid-range local GPU | Image Edit, Multiple Angles | Often needs 12-16 GB VRAM |
| Pro | Higher-end local GPU | WAN 2.2 image-to-video | Usually wants 24 GB+ VRAM |
| Cloud | Partner-node / credit-backed | Nano Banana 2 and other cloud workflows | Local VRAM is not the main constraint |

VRAM guidance is approximate. Resolution, frame count, model variant, batch size, and other running apps can change the real requirement significantly.

## Cloud Pricing Notes

Cloud workflows can display:

- estimated credits per run
- approximate USD conversion
- projected plan totals in Director Mode

For some workflows, pricing is dynamic. In those cases the UI shows a dynamic pricing label when the estimate is not fixed. Live account balance is not currently shown in-app.

## Stock and LLM Integrations

### Stock

The `Stock` tab uses Pexels.

- Add a Pexels API key in `Settings`.
- Search and import photos or videos directly into the current project.

### LLM

The `LLM` tab connects to LM Studio.

- Start LM Studio locally.
- Enable the local API server.
- Load a model.
- Use the model to refine prompts before generating.

If your GPU memory is tight, unload the LM Studio model before heavy ComfyUI generation.

## Workflow Starter Pack

The Starter Pack is the supported setup bridge for advanced ComfyUI users who want a clearer dependency and workflow-prep path.

Generate it with:

```bash
npm run starter-pack:build
```

## Known Constraints

- ComfyUI is local-only in this build.
- Some workflows require manual model or custom-node installation on the user's ComfyUI machine.
- Cloud pricing can be dynamic for certain partner workflows.
- Live partner credit balance is not currently shown in-app.
